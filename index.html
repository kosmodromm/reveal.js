				<h2>Scrum is?</h2>
				<p>Scrum is a process framework helping team to collaborate on complex projects and products.</p>

				<ul>

					Scrum is a process framework helping team to collaborate on complex projects and products. It is
					flexible and has a very wide range of applications.Scrum gives the client the ability to make
					changes to requirements at any given time. That what makes scrum attractive to many software
					customers.
					Term "Scrum" comes from reckby, means the starting state of the teams before throwing in the ball -
					the minimum required set of activities, artifacts and roles on which the scrum development process
					is based.
					Scrum is usualy used on project having no algoritmic solutions. In such conditions, it is better not
					to think through the whole plan in advance, but to put forward hypotheses and make experiments to
					test them.

					So the team of the company's employees should be self-organized, learn from the experience, use the
					solution to the problem, and analyze their successes and failures to constantly improve.

					<h2>What's with the team?</h2>
					<p>Scrum teams are small, usually with five to nine people.</p>
					<img src="../dist/img/team.png" alt=""><br>
					<ul>
						<li>product owner</li>
						<li>the Scrum master </li>
						<li>development team</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Scrum teams are small, usually with five to nine people.

						The Scrum team consist of three roles:
						Product Owner
						The Scrum Master
						Development Team</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Product owner</h2>
					<p>Defines the end goal and the tasks that it takes to get there.</p>
					<aside class="notes">The Product Owner is The person with the product vision. Product owner defines
						the end goal and the tasks that it takes to get there. He creates the backlog of to-do list
						items and reviews deliverables before the product is delivered.
						The Product Owner is passionate about the product and has the clearest idea of why it should
						exist - therefore, they will know instantly when it’s not right. They need to be clear
						communicators and create maximum transparency within the team.
						Product Owner may not “own” any individual tasks on the Scrum board but oversees all and
						intervenes when necessary. The Product Owner is ultimately responsible for making sure the
						workflow is going smoothly.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The Scrum Master</h2>
					<p>They educate teams, product owners, and the rest of the company on the intricacies of the Scrum
						process and try to optimize the application of this practice.</p>
					<aside class="notes">The Scrum Master - The role of the Scrum Master is not a traditional team lead
						or project manager he is more the role of coach.The scrum expert who helps the team build the
						product according to the scrum framework. They educate teams, product owners, and the rest of
						the company on the intricacies of the Scrum process and try to optimize the application of this
						practice.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Development Team</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>accept assignments</li>
						<li>work collaboratively</li>
						<li>consult Scrum Master</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Development Team - consists of specialists who work directly on the product.
						Team members get stuff done. They accept assignments, work on them independently and
						collaboratively, consult each other and the Scrum Master when they have questions, and have to
						ward off distractions for the duration of the sprint. As long as the work gets done, there’s no
						right way to do it.</aside>

				<h2>Basis of Scrum</h2>
				<img src="../dist/img/sprint.png" alt=""><br>
				<ul><b style="color: rgb(37, 99, 134);">Sprint</b>
					<li>planning</li>
					<li>backlog</li>
					<li>1-4 weeks</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes"> The basis of Scrum is Sprint, during which team works on the project. Sprint is
					period always time limited (1-4 weeks) and has the same length throughout the life of the product.
					In the end of Sprint, a new working version of the product should be received.
					Sprint Planning is performed before the start of each Sprint , it evaluates the content of the
					Product Backlog and the formulate of a Sprint Backlog which contains the tasks (Story, Bugs, Tasks)
					that must be completed in the current sprint.
					Each day during a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum in which each team member answers the
					questions "what did I do yesterday?", "What do I plan to do today?", "What was difficult in my
					work?" The task of the Daily Scrum is to determine the status and progress of work on Sprint, early
					detection of problems and develop decisions of changing strategies to achieve Sprint's goals.

				<h2>Sprint Review & Sprint Retrospective</h2>
				<img src="../dist/img/arrows.png" alt="">
				<ul>
					<li>assessment of team productivity</li>
					<li>efficiency</li>
					<li>problems</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">At the end of Sprint, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective are produced, the
					purpose of which is to estimate the productivity of the team in the last Sprint, predict the
					expected efficiency (performance) in the next sprint, detect existing problems
					Each sprint must have a goal that motivates and is achieved by completing tasks from the Sprint
					Backlog.</aside>

				<h2>Advantages</h2>
				<img src="../dist/img/plus.png" alt="" style="width: 400px;">
				<ul>
					<li>responsive</li>
					<li>flexible</li>
					<li>easy to learn</li>
					<li>each sprint = working product</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">Scrum is customer centric, responsive. Scrum gives the client the ability to make
					changes to requirements at any given time. Scrum is quite easy to learn and saves time by
					eliminating non-critical activities. Scrum allows you to get a potentially working product at the
					end of each Sprint.</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Limitations</h2>
				<img src="../dist/img/minus.png" alt="" style="width: 400px;">
				<ul>
					<li>flexible is not so good...</li>
					<li>self-organizing, multi-functional team is rare</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">Scrum belongs to the Agile family, so Scrum welcomes changes in requirements at any
					time (Product backlog can be changed at any time). This makes it difficult to use Scrum in
					fixed-cost / fixed-time projects.The Scrum ideology argues that it is impossible to predict all
					upcoming changes, so there is no point in planning project in advance, limiting planning only the
					work that needs to be done in the current Sprint.
					Another weakness in Scrum is its emphasis on a self-organizing, multi-functional team. According to
					research by sociologists, the number of self-motivated employees able to be self-organized is less
					then 15% of the working population.</aside>
